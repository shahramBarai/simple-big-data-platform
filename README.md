# Simple Big Data Platform

Hi, my name is Shahram Barai, first-year master's student in Computer, Communication, and Information Sciences, specializing in Computer Science: Software Systems and Technologies at Aalto University.

This repository contains assignments for the Big Data Platforms course _(completed in spring 2023)_, where my task was to build a simple big data platform.

## Architecture

The following are the pictures of the evolution of the platform architecture, starting from the first assignment and culminating in the third and final assignment.
